# Gamify Gains

🌟 Project Overview

Gamify Gains is a transformative productivity application designed to help users conquer personal goals in fitness by applying the addictive mechanics of video games. Instead of tedious tracking, users earn experience points (XP), level up, unlock achievements, and compete on leaderboards, turning daily exercises into compelling quests. We believe that motivation shouldn't be a chore—it should be a game.

✨ Key Features

XP & Leveling System: Complete habits and tasks to earn XP and progress through levels, unlocking new features and customizations.

Custom Quests (Goals): Define your own personalized goals (e.g., "Lose weight," "Build Muscle", "Eat healthy") and track your progress in real-time.

Achievement Badges: Earn unique digital badges for hitting milestones, providing instant positive reinforcement.

Multi-Category Tracking: Intuitive, seamless UI to enter your daily exercise routine for every day M-F. Add your diet plans for every day as well as the option to add Cheat Days and Skip Days per your tradition every week. Add photos every day to complete quests and earn points!

Visual Progress Bar: An intuitive, visually engaging interface that shows how far you are from reaching your next major objective.

Photo Gallery: Upload your gains every day to track your progress! (Data is never shared)

PERSONAL AI TRAINER: Takes all the info you've entered as context and is able to answer any of your fitness questions, tailoring its responses to your needs. It can generate workout plans on a daily basis for you, count your calories, and observe your gains over the years from your photos if you would like to share them! It can give you detailed feedback on every aspect of your fitness journey

Social Integration (Leaderboards): Compete with friends or community members on weekly leaderboards to boost friendly rivalry and accountability.
